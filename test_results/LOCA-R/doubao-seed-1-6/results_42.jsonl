Its center of mass is at \\((x, y=b)\\) where \\(b>0\\) and \\(x\\) is variable.  \n- Molecule B is connected via a massless, smooth, insulating axis (perpendicular to the x-y plane, negligible length) to a smooth thin rail along \\(y=b\\) (parallel to the x-axis). This allows B to slide freely along the rail (changing \\(x\\)) and rotate freely around the axis (changing \\(\\theta\\)).  \n- Molecule B has mass \\(m\\), and its rotational inertia around the axis is \\(I = \\frac{1}{12}mb^2\\).  \n- Vacuum permittivity is \\(\\varepsilon_0\\), and gravity is ignored.\n\n\n#### Variables and Parameters\n- \\(\\boldsymbol{p}_1\\): Dipole moment of A (vector \\((0,p)\\), magnitude \\(p\\)).  \n- \\(\\boldsymbol{p}_2\\): Dipole moment of B (vector \\((p\\sin\\theta, p\\cos\\theta)\\), magnitude \\(p\\)).  \n- \\(O\\): Origin \\((0,0)\\), fixed position of A.  \n- \\(b\\): Y-coordinate of B’s rail (\\(b>0\\), constant).  \n- \\(x\\): X-coordinate of B’s center of mass (variable).  \n- \\(\\theta\\): Angle of \\(\\boldsymbol{p}_2\\) with the positive y-axis (variable, \\(-\\pi < \\theta \\leq \\pi\\)).  \n- \\(m\\): Mass of B (constant).  \n- \\(I\\): Rotational inertia of B around its axis (\\(I=\\frac{1}{12}mb^2\\), constant).  \n- \\(\\boldsymbol{e}_x, \\boldsymbol{e}_y\\): Unit vectors along x and y axes.  \n- \\(\\varepsilon_0\\): Vacuum permittivity (constant).  \n- \\(\\boldsymbol{E}_1\\): Electric field at B due to A (to find in part 1).  \n- \\(F_x\\): X-component of electric force on B (part 2).  \n- \\(M\\): Torque on B around its axis (part 2).  \n- \\(a\\): Initial x-coordinate of B in part 4 (\\(0<a<<b\\), constant).  \n- \\(t\\): Time variable (parts 3,4).  \n- \\(x(t)\\): Time-dependent x-coordinate of B (parts3,4).  \n- \\(\\theta(t)\\): Time-dependent angle of \\(\\boldsymbol{p}_2\\) (parts3,4).  \n\n\n#### Initial Conditions\n- **Part4**: At \\(t=0\\): \\(x=a\\) (\\(0<a<<b\\)), \\(\\theta=0\\), and B is at rest (\\(\\frac{dx}{dt}=0\\), \\(\\frac{d\\theta}{dt}=0\\)).  \n- **Part3**: Small deviation from equilibrium (no exact initial values given, only small deviations implied).  \n\n\n#### Constraints and Assumptions\n1. 2D system (x-y plane).  \n2.

Due to the Pauli exclusion principle, a spherical small cavity (called an \"electron bubble\") forms around the electron (with no helium atoms inside). Outside the bubble, helium atoms are polarized by the electron's electric field, leading to an increased density of helium atoms. The electron, bubble, and attracted helium atoms accelerate together when the electron accelerates, resulting in a much larger effective mass for the electron than its free mass.

(45分) 等离子体被称为物质的第四态，宇宙中 $99\\%$ 的可见物质都可视为等离子体。等离子体是由大量电子、离子和中性粒子等组成的电中性物质，它由于阴离子和阳离子的电荷量相等，整体呈现准中性而得名。等离子体的电中性也体现在等离子体对电场有良好的屏蔽效果，这称之为德拜屏蔽。现考虑由电子和 $+1$ 价阳离子组成的等离子体，在平衡状态下，离子和电子的数密度 $n_j$ ($j=\\text{i, e}$ 分别表示离子和电子)都满足玻尔兹曼分布\n$$\nn_j = n_{j0} \\exp \\left( - \\frac{q_j \\phi}{k_B T_j} \\right)\n$$\n其中 $n_{j0}$ 为常量，$q_j$ 为电荷量，$\\phi$ 为静电势，$T_j$ 为绝对温度，$k_B$ 为玻尔兹曼常量。弱耦合条件为 $\\frac{q_j \\phi}{k_B T_j} \\ll 1$，准中性的条件为 $n_{\\text{i}0} = n_{\\text{e}0} = n_0$，元电荷量用 $e$ 表示。\n\n(1) 一维等离子体中的粒子满足方程 (动量方程)\n$$\nm_j n_j (\\partial_t v_j + v_j \\partial_x v_j) = q_j n_j E - \\partial_x p_j\n$$\n其中 $m_j$、$v_j$ 分别为粒子的质量和宏观速度，$E$ 为电场强度，$p_j$ 为压强。由此证明在平衡状态下电子满足玻尔兹曼分布 (此时电子温度空间分布均匀且不随时间变化)。\n\n(2) 现将一个试探点电荷 $q$ 放入题干所述等离子体中，在弱耦合条件下：\n(2.1) 求稳态时三维空间的静电势分布 $\\phi(r)$，$r$ 是场点到电荷 $q$ 的距离；\n(2.2) 导出电势分布 $\\phi(r)$ 的特征长度即德拜屏蔽长度 $\\lambda_D$ ($\\lambda_D \\equiv \\frac{-\\phi r}{\\mathrm{d}(\\phi r)/\\mathrm{d}r}$) 的表达式和电子德拜屏蔽长度 $\\lambda_{De}$ 的表达式 (电子德拜屏蔽长度是指离子温度趋于无穷时的德拜屏蔽长度)；\n(2.3) 已知 $n_0 = 1.0 \\times 10^{20} \\text{ m}^{-3}$，$\\epsilon_0 = 8.854 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ F/m}$，$k_B T_e = 10 \\text{ keV}$，$k_B T_i = 1.0 \\text{ keV}$，$e = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ C}$，给出德拜屏蔽长度 $\\lambda_D$ 的数值。\n\n(3) 德拜屏蔽效应显示，等离子体中的电荷分离效应只在 $\\lambda_D$ 尺度上存在，在远大于 $\\lambda_D$ 尺度上，等离子体可视为准中性。但在离子宏观速度 $\\boldsymbol{v}_i$ 和外磁场 $\\boldsymbol{B}$ 不为零的情况下，离子流受力平衡 (忽略压强) 的条件要求存在非零的平衡电场，因而 $\\Delta n = n_i - n_e \\ne 0$。假定电场强度 $E$ 的梯度标长为 $L$ (若电场沿着 $x$ 方向的分布不均匀，梯度标长为 $\\frac{E}{\\mathrm{d}E/\\mathrm{d}x}$)，系统运动的特征圆频率 $\\omega_0 \\approx \\frac{v_i}{L}$。用 $\\omega_{pe}$ (即 $\\sqrt{\\frac{e^2 n_0}{\\epsilon_0 m_e}}$)、$\\omega_{ce}$ (即 $\\frac{eB}{m_e}$) 和 $\\omega_0$ 将 $\\frac{\\Delta n}{n}$ 近似表出；假定特征频率 $\\frac{\\omega_0}{2\\pi} = 1 \\text{GHz}$，磁场 $B = 1 \\text{T}$，$n_0 = 1 \\times 10^{20} \\text{ m}^{-3}$，估算 $\\frac{\\Delta n}{n}$ 的数值。\n\n(4) 电子与离子的巨大质量差异使得等离子体中的波动现象丰富而复杂，从次声波到超高频的电磁波都可以在等离子体中观测到。现在我们关注声波频率范围内的波动现象。无磁场情况下，等离子体中的各成分除满足 (1) 中的动量方程之外，还受到如下方程组的约束：\n$$\n\\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{l}\n\\partial_t n_j + \\partial_x (n_j v_j) = 0 \\\n(\\partial_t + v_j \\partial_x) (p_j n_j^{-\\gamma_j}) = 0 \\\n\\partial_x E = \\frac{e}{\\epsilon_0} (n_i - n_e)\n\\end{array}\n\\right.\n$$\n其中，$\\gamma_j$ ($j=\\text{i, e}$) 表示粒子的多方指数。假设等离子体平衡时在自由空间中均匀分布且无宏观流动，现在该等离子体中有 $\\exp(-i\\omega t + ikx)$ 形式的小扰动，保留扰动量的一阶项，利用上述方程组导出 $\\omega$ 与 $k$ 满足的一般关系式，用 $\\omega$、$k$、$\\gamma_j$、$m_j$、$T_j$、$\\lambda_{De}$ 和 $k_B$ 表示 (所有扰动量的下标用 1 表示，未扰动量用 0 表示)。\n\n(5) 在 $\\omega^2$ 与 $k^2 \\frac{k_B T_e}{m_i}$ 量级相同 ($T_e$ 与 $T_i$ 量级相同) 的情况下，从第 (4) 问中的一般关系式导出 $\\omega^2 = \\omega^2(k)$ 的简化表达式，即所谓的色散关系 (只保留领头阶项)；在什么条件下，该色散关系可以退化成经典离子声波的色散关系 $\\omega^2 = k^2 \\frac{\\gamma_e k_B T_e + \\gamma_i k_B T_i}{m_i}$？\n\n(6) 在 $\\omega^2$ 与 $k^2 \\frac{k_B T_e}{m_e}$ 量级相同 ($T_e$ 与 $T_i$ 量级相同) 的情况下，第 (4) 问中的一般关系式又给出怎样的简化色散关系 (只保留领头阶项)？并给出波的群速度 $v_g$ 的表达式 (用 $\\omega_{pe}^2$ 和其他已知量表示)。\n\n(7) 假设电子满足弱耦合条件下的玻尔兹曼分布，第 (4) 问中的方程 $\\partial_x E = \\frac{e}{\\epsilon_0} (n_i - n_e)$ 换成准中性条件 $n_i = n_e$，离子满足的方程保持不变，导出此时离子声波的色散关系 $\\omega^2 = \\omega^2(k)$，并指出如何由经典离子声波的色散关系 (见第 (5) 问) 得到该结果。", "solutions": "TBA", "final_answers": "\\[TBA\\]", "figure_paths": [], "improved_solutions": "# Problem Explanation\n---\n### Problem Interpretation\n\n#### Physical System Description\nThe system consists of a plasma composed of electrons and +1-valent cations (ions).
